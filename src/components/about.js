                <p class="about-body">
                    I've been an aspiring programmer and game designer ever since I was introduced to the game platform Roblox in 2013 at the
                    age of twelve. Previously, I’ve volunteered at Roblox as a member of their Post Approval team in their forums, which aims
                    to help users who are starting their Roblox careers to receive the help and knowledge needed to create insightful posts and
                    to learn new skills. I’m also a former intern at the company as an accelerator, where I worked on creating an immersive
                    experience in Roblox alongside some of the best people in the industry, such as professional game designers, product managers,
                    and engineers.

                <p class="about-body">
                    I’m completely self-taught, and I aspire to perfect my craft by practicing & learning new languages and software, such as React.
                    My interests include puzzle solving, creating open source software, and designing & creating websites. When I’m not programming,
                    I like to go for long walks, watch movies with friends, and play Apex Legends.
